# Welcome

We are pleased to announce the launch of the Digital Classicist Berlin, a seminar series inspired by the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.digitalclassicist.org/wip/">ICS London Seminar</a>. 

The seminar is now in full swing: the abstracts and slides for the first few talks are already online ([here](berlin/seminar2012)) and we'll start soon publishing the lecture videos as well!
