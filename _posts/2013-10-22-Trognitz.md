## Abstract

In this talk an expert system for the computer-aided classification and dating of ancient vases will be presented. The program uses Natural Language Processing methods to address an archaeological research question.

This system’s knowledge base is modelled as a decision tree. By answering the questions posed by EVA the user is gradually guided through a detailed and comprehensive examination of all the characteristics of the object. By answering all the questions the system finally comes to a conclusion that is then communicated to the user.

In an alternative mode of the system the user can input a written description of the object in natural language. By means of information extraction techniques, EVA is able to filter the relevant information from the given text in order to answer the questions autonomously.

The knowledge base of this system is independent and fully exchangeable. And because the syntax is simple it can also be extended or changed by non-programmers.

First tests with geometric vases show that this approach is capable of useful results.
