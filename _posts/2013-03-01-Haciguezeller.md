## Abstract

Within social sciences and humanities research, spatial configuration of built environment at the architectural and urban scales is often studied with the help of space syntax theory and techniques. Although the value of space syntax approaches can certainly not be overlooked, it is somewhat inopportune that a well-developed existing technology such as geographical information systems (GIS) - that affords spatial modelling with raster data structure, and mapping spatial analysis results in visually powerful and statistically informed ways - has wide applicability at the landscape level but far less so at the architectural and urban scales. 

In the presentation, two original GIS-based techniques to study spatial configuration of built environment at the architectural and urban scales, namely metric and visual integration analysis, will be introduced. The techniques are anchored in GIS-based cost-distance and visibility analysis both carried out with raster datasets. They treat absolute distance and visibility as configurational measures in a way similar to space syntax. Despite this similarity, however, the GIS-based analyses to be presented differ from space syntax technique in various and important respects as will be discussed.
