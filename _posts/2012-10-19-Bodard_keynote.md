## Abstract

This paper will discuss the history of public epigraphic databases,
including the Packard Greek Inscriptions database, the Epigraphische
Datenbank Heidelberg and Epigraphik-Datenbank Clauss-Slaby, discussing
the strengths and weaknesses of the approaches to online collections,
especially with reference to scale, usability, technical standards,
openness and transparency, collaboration and discoverability through
metadata. Some consideration of user reactions to these databases will
lead to the conclusion that the Digital Humanities perspectives
discussed above do not reflect well the desires and apparent needs of
normal epigraphic scholars. Does this disjunction of priorities
suggest that we should reconsider the aims of electronic publication,
or attempt to educate academics as to the importance of standards and
metadata? The paper will close with a suggestion for an approach
drawing from the papyrological community that might combine these two
facets, building scale without sacrificing quality, and harnessing the
epigraphic scholarly community to build a more powerful and
interoperable epigraphic corpus.
