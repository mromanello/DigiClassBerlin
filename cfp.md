#  Call for Papers

We are pleased to announce the launch of a Digital Classicist seminar series in Berlin, will which will start running in Autumn 2012. The seminar was inspired by a sister initiative established in 2006 in London, and was organised in association with the German Archaeological Institute and the Excellence Cluster TOPOI.

We warmly welcome contributions from students as well as established researchers and practitioners. Themes could include digital text, linguistics technology, imaging and visualisation, linked data, open access, geographic analysis, serious gaming and any other digital or quantitative methods. While we welcome high-quality application papers discussing individual projects, the series also hopes to accommodate broader theoretical consideration of the use of digital technology in Classical studies. The content should be of interest both to classicists, ancient historians or archaeologists, and to information scientists or digital humanists, and have an academic research agenda relevant to at least one of those fields.

The seminars will run on Tuesday evenings (17:00-18:30) starting from October 2012 in the TOPOI Haus, Dahlem, hosted by the Excellence Cluster TOPOI.

There is a budget to assist with travel to Berlin (usually from within Germany, we have occasionally been able to assist international presenters to attend, so please enquire).

Paper submission is now open: upload your abstract of 300-500 words max. (bibliographic references excluded) using **[this form](submit)** by 14 September 2012 (Berlin time).
